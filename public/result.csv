In other words: they paid it forward.It's awesome to see how a micro action from my end could lead to this tiny trend.I think the pay-it-forward culture is key to nurture a global community of ambitious creators: I can only hope the movement will grow bigger with time!When are you opening your own office hours? :)",25,4,2mo,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamil-debbagh,2023-06-12T11:49:14.984Z,,
