In other words: they paid it forward.It's awesome to see how a micro action from my end could lead to this tiny trend.I think the pay-it-forward culture is key to nurture a global community of ambitious creators: I can only hope the movement will grow bigger with time!When are you opening your own office hours? :)",25,4,2mo,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamil-debbagh,2023-06-12T11:49:14.984Z,,,,,,

His impact went far beyond the boxing ring, as he became an icon of social activism and a symbol of resilience and determination.Ali began his boxing journey at the age of 12 when he stepped into a local gym, under the guidance of trainer Joe Martin. His talent quickly became evident as he won his first amateur bout. In 1960, at the age of 18, Ali earned a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the Rome Olympics, marking his entrance onto the international stage.In 1964, Ali emerged as a prominent figure in the professional boxing world when he faced Sonny Liston for the heavyweight title. Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, displayed his incredible speed and footwork, earning him a surprise victory and making him the new heavyweight champion. It was after this fight that he announced his conversion to Islam and his name change to Muhammad Ali.Ali's boxing career was not without its challenges. In 1967, during the height of the Vietnam War, he refused to be drafted into the military, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the war. This decision led to his boxing license being revoked, and he was stripped of his titles. Ali spent the following years fighting a legal battle that eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor in 1971, allowing him to return to boxing.Known for his flamboyant personality and witty rhymes, Ali used his platform to express his views on civil rights, racial equality, and social justice. His outspokenness made him both beloved and controversial, but it undeniably solidified his status as a cultural and political figure. Ali's fights against Joe Frazier, particularly the epic ""Fight of the Century"" in 1971, and his ""Rumble in the Jungle"" bout against George Foreman in 1974, where he employed his famous ""rope-a-dope"" strategy, became legendary moments in sports history.Ali retired from boxing in 1981, leaving behind a remarkable legacy. He finished his career with a record of 56 wins (including 37 knockouts) and only 5 losses. Beyond his boxing achievements, Ali's activism and philanthropy continued to inspire people around the world. He was recognized with numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and his life story was captured in books, documentaries, and films.Muhammad Ali passed away on June 3, 2016, but his impact on boxing and society continues to resonate. He will always be remembered as a true champion inside and outside the ring, who fought not only for his own success but also for the rights and dignity of others.",183,16,1d,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAAD_r7UBiCrT549LbxtggKVX5Cqq_MLMli4,NAME_SEARCH,uNCu",2023-06-12T18:01:53.764Z,https://dms.licdn.com/playlist/vid/D4D05AQG2GOlnB-NN6w/mp4-640p-30fp-crf28/0/1686455548832?e=1687201200&v=beta&t=odyaTJ7d5LYHMRNCRV_RErPsgMUS3v9NP7n0yx-xywU,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/aamirahsankhan,24,

Adam Coffey is the founding partner of CEO Advisory Guru, LLC. Best-selling author of The Private Equity Playbook and The Exit-Strategy Playbook. KEY TAKEAWAYS:🔑 Many business owners use a magic hockey stick approach to valuation, indicating that upon their exit, the company will somehow produce record-beating results never seen before. The best way to demonstrate any success is to actually test the water.🔑  With 80% of all deals going to private equity, it's more important than ever that we understand how that universe works, in order to maximise our own potential.🔑 Business owners focus their entire energies on building their company. That same level of dedication is needed when it comes time to exit.🔑 Private equity firms rely on investment bankers to sell their companies, managing competitive tension and the entire process.

But May has been truly amazing. I feel super grateful and excited to share these updates from Flowla :💙 This month we doubled our MRR since March and saw an 8x increase in sign-ups compared to April. 👊 The majority of our new users are active, creating and sharing  flows every week.💙 We had our first ""major"" accounts with multiple seats signing up with no hand-holding required and expanding in those accounts.🙏 AND TO ME THAT'S THE MOST REWARDING!  To see happy users inviting others to join, and decision makers willing to invest - is the biggest validation!💙 Had so many people telling me they see Flowla all over LinkedIn and I even started randomly running into new users at events - from zero awareness 9 months ago to bumping into users physically 💙🙏 Some in my network who were initially hesitant about Flowla are now scheduling meetings with their decision makers to explore how we can improve the buyer experience.🎉 IT'S HARD BUT I'M GREATFUL!I'll be honest, the journey is sometimes tiring BUT looking back, I'm grateful it's paying off.BECAUSE IN LIFE SOMETIMES NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO IT MAY NOT PAY OFF! I've learnt it through experience and observation.🎉 Success is not guaranteed. But what else do we have other than pushing hard to achieve our goals?

I crave a sense of progress and urgency. That's where these nifty quartered circles called Harvey Balls come in. They visually represent completion levels and keep me motivated like nothing else. Think of them as the superheroes of task tracking! 💪⏰3️⃣ Less is more: With my hectic schedule filled with back-to-back calls and meetings, I've learned the hard way that focusing on just two main tasks per day is the way to go.

A little AI can always help, especially since hiring has become so expensive and risky. ️☝️ The biggest issue, of course, is figuring out how to use AI. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Sometimes, you need to tailor it.Microsoft's Greg Wilson recently announced something huge from the company. GPT-4 is now available in Azure OpenAI's Service. This will allow companies to create their own applications with a GPT-4 base. Scaling major endeavors may become easier as a result. After all, AI can do the work that was once relegated exclusively to people. I love hearing news like this, simply because it shows how creative company scaling can become. At Hardboot Inc. | Staffing & Resourcing, our company vision is simple: to help businesses hire the best ReactJs, Front-end, and AI developers (and virtual assistant superheroes) without spending their life savings. ️❓What can we as a community do to make AI tailoring more accessible to startups?I want to hear your two cents.

What might be less obvious is exactly how far we've come as a result of their leadership. It's not often that an organization is founded by two people who are incredibly fast-paced and visionary.

What's even less common is that they consistently inspire their team to do the same.The amount that our team has accomplished in such a short time as well as the environment of collaboration and hard work are a testament to the culture these two have built by example.

These architecture patterns are among the most commonly used in app development, whether on iOS or Android platforms. Developers have introduced them to overcome the limitations of earlier patterns. So, how do they differ?  🔹 MVC, the oldest pattern, dates back almost 50 years 🔹 Every pattern has a ""view"" (V) responsible for displaying content and receiving user input 🔹 Most patterns include a ""model"" (M) to manage business data 🔹 ""Controller,"" ""presenter,"" and ""view-model"" are translators that mediate between the view and the model (""entity"" in the VIPER pattern) 🔹 These translators can be quite complex to write, so various patterns have been proposed to make them more maintainable  Over to you: keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list of architecture patterns. Other notable patterns include Flux and Redux.

In other words, the Metaverse is a synthesized world which is composed of user-controlled avatars, digital things, virtual environments and other computer-generated elements, where humans (represented by avatars) can use their virtual identity through any smart device to communicate, collaborate, and socialize with each other.📌 What the relationships between the three worlds, the components in the Metaverse and the information flow of the Metaverse in detail?1️⃣ HUMAN SOCIETY 👇The Metaverse is regarded as Human-Centric. Human users along with their inner psychologies and social interactions constitute the human world. Equipped with smart wearable devices (e.g., VR/AR helmets), humans can interact and control their digital avatars to play, work, socialize, and interact with other avatars or virtual entities in the Metaverse via Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Extended Reality (XR) tech.2️⃣ PHISICAL INFRASTRUCTURES 👇The physical world offers supporting infrastructures (including sensing/control, communication, computation, and storage infrastructures) to the Metaverse to support multi-sensory data perception, transmission, processing, and caching, as well as physical control, thereby enabling efficient interactions with both the digital and human worlds3️⃣ INTERCONNECTED VIRTUAL WORLDS 👇The digital world can be composed of a series of interconnected distributed virtual worlds (i.e., sub-Metaverses), and each sub- Metaverse can offer certain kinds of virtual goods/services (e.g., gaming, social dating, online museum, and online concert) and virtual environments (e.g., game scenes and virtual cities) to users represented as digital avatars.4️⃣ METAVERSE ENGINE 👇The Metaverse engine uses the #BigData from the real world as inputs to generate, maintain and update the virtual world via the interactivity, AI, digital twin, and blockchain technologies.5️⃣ IN-WORLD INFORMATION FLOW 👇The human society or human world is interconnected by social networks and formed based on common activities and mutual interactions among human beings. In the physical world, the IoT-enabled sensing/control infrastructure plays an important role in digitizing/transforming the physical world via pervasive sensors and actuators, and the generated IoT big data is transmitted and processed via network and computation infrastructures.6️⃣ INFORMATION FLOW ACROSS WORLDS 👇The subjective consciousness, the Internet, and the IoT are the main media among the three worlds.IEEE via Enrico Molinari #ChatGPT #marketing #finserv #fintech #govtech #ehealth #smartcities #insurtech",740,58,3mo,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAAC2KVkBLNv7gXx2jWh3f1KOpegbXnMfbg4,NAME_SEARCH,0ykn",2023-06-12T18:05:08.902Z,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrico-molinari,159,
